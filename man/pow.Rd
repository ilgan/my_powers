\title{Generic Power Function}
\usage{
pow(x, a = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Vector to raise to some power.}

\item{a}{Power to raise \code{x} by. Default is 2 (although doing
so is rather silly!)}
}
\value{
The vector \code{x}, raised to the power of \code{a}.
}
\description{
This function raises a vector to any power. I'm making it internal,
by not \code{export}ing, because I don't want users to use it.
Why not? Because I said so!
