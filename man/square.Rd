\description{
That's it -- these functions just square or cube a vector.
}
\details{
This function isn't complicated.

And it almost certainly doesn't need two paragraphs in the "Details"
section!

Here are some reasons why putting a list in this section is excessive:
\itemize{
     \item These functions are quite simple.
     \item There's nothing else to say about these functions.
}

If you really want to see more, check out the internal \code{\link{pow}}
function that these functions depend on.
